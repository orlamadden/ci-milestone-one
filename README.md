# Milestone Project One - Matt's Café

## Code Institute / User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Tasked to create a static website combining knowledge from the first three modules in the Full Stack Web Development course with the Code Institute. 

I decided to build a fictional café website called Matt’s Café. This website allows customers and potential customers of the café to view the menu, opening hours and location before visiting.

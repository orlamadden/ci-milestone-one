# Milestone Project One - Matt's Café

## Code Institute / User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Tasked to create a static website combining knowledge from the first three modules in the Full Stack Web Development course with the Code Institute. 

I decided to build a fictional café website called Matt’s Café. This website allows customers and potential customers of the café to view the menu, opening hours and location before visiting.

## UX

The goal of this website for customers and potential customers is to:
- Provide menu option listings.
- Show the café location.
- Display opening hours.

The business owner goals of this website are to:
- Build brand awareness.
- Attract more visitors and increase sales.

#### USER STORIES

1.	As a potential customer (and returning customer), I want to check the opening hours of Matt’s Café so I know it is open when I arrive.
2.	As a potential customer, I want to check the location of Matt’s Café as I have never been there before and want to know where it is.
3.	As a potential customer (and returning customer), I want to read the menu before I decide to eat here.
4.	As a potential customer I want to see if Matt’s Café has social media presence so I can see what other people on Facebook are saying about them.
5.	As a potential customer I want to be able to check Matt’s Café on my mobile device as I do not own a laptop or desktop.
6.	As a potential customer I want to see images of what Matt’s Café has on offer.
7.	As a potential customer I want to be able to contact Matt’s Café if the website does not answer all my questions.
8.	As a potential customer with dietary requirements, I want to contact Matt to see if they can offer a Vegetarian/Vegan alternative to their current menu.
9.	As the owner of Matt’s Café, I want to give visitors enough information and details to entice them to call in to my Café or get in touch if they require more information.

## Features

The following is a summary of the features already in place and those that could perhaps be implemented in the future.
#### Navbar
The main aim of the navbar is to navigate the website The navbar is featured on all pages. 
- The café logo is featured on the left side of the navigation bar which links back to the home page when clicked.
- The page item links are on the right side of the navigation bar, featuring:
   * Home
   * Menu
   * Contact
- The navbar collapses into a burger menu when resized to tablet and mobile view.
#### Footer
- The footer is featured on all pages. It contains:
   * Location
   * Opening hours
   * Newsletter signup

- The secondary footer contains social media links for Matt’s Café and copyright information.

#### Video
- The inclusion of a video on the home page was for educational purposes only. As Matt’s Café is fictional, this video does not promote my website but would be a compliment to the website.

#### Newsletter Signup form
- The footer provides a very basic signup form for users to enter if they want to receive a monthly newsletter from Matt’s Café.

#### Contact us form
- The contact page features a form so visitors can contact Matt’s Café looking for more information that may not have been addressed on the website.

#### Menu list
- The menu list on the menu page gives visitors a complete overview of what Matt’s Café offers, along with menu item description and menu item pricing.

#### FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS
- I would create a small section above the header that would feature the current day and the opening hours associated with that day.
- I would create a section that would display daily offers associated with the current day of website visitation.
